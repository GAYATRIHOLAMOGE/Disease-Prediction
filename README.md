🏥 Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict diseases based on symptoms and patient profiles. It leverages a dataset containing various symptoms and their associated diseases to make accurate predictions.

 📌 Features
- Predicts diseases based on input symptoms.
- Utilizes a structured dataset for training.
- Implements data preprocessing and model training in a Jupyter Notebook.
- Provides insights into symptom-disease relationships.

 🗂 Dataset
- **File:** `Disease_symptom_and_patient_profile_dataset.csv`
- Contains patient symptoms and associated diseases.
- Used for training the predictive model.
-
  🚀 Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebook.
- Run the cells to preprocess data and train the model.
- Input symptoms to predict the possible disease.

 📊 Model & Approach
- Uses machine learning classification algorithms.
- Applies data cleaning, feature selection, and model evaluation techniques.
- Compares different models for optimal performance.

 🛠 Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
